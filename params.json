It enables on-demand crop, resizing and flipping of images.\r\n\r\nIt also features a VERY smart detection of important points in the image for better cropping and resizing, using state-of-the-art face and feature detection algorithms (more on that in Detection Algorithms).\r\n\r\nUsing thumbor is very easy (after it is running). All you have to do is access it using an URL for an image, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://<thumbor-server>/300x200/smart/s.glbimg.com/et/bb/f/original/2011/03/24/VN0JiwzmOw0b0lg.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat URL would show an image of the big brother brasil participants in 300x200 using smart crop.\r\n\r\nThere are several other options to the image URL configuration. You can check them in the Usage page.\r\n\r\nFor more information check [thumbor's\r\ndocumentation](https://github.com/globocom/thumbor/wiki \"thumbor docs\").\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nYou can see thumbor in action at http://thumborize.me/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
